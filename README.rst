HydroFlows is a Python package for automated workflows for globally applicable flood risk assessments.
At its core it contains a set of methods that can be called via command line interface (CLI) or Python API.
These are combined into `snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io>`__ workflows to perform a series of tasks that are common to flood risk assessments.
