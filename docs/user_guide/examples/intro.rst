Example workflows
=================

In this section we provide some example notebooks to illustrate possible applications of HydroFlows.
The example workflows can with some test data for a specific region in Northen Italy,
but they can be easily adapted to other regions by changing the input data.
Currently, all applications are focused on flood hazard and risk assessments.
A full list of the available examples is provided below.
